## Setup for contributing to the project

Make sure you have a pretty modern Python 3.6/7/8 or something. I tried with 3.5.5 and had a syntax error.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository so you have your own copy.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your local machine.
3. `cd` into the directory and run `pip install -e .`
4. Run `main.py` to test that your setup is working `python main.py`
